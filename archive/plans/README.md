# Implementation Plans

This directory contains detailed implementation plans for Doc Helper development phases.

## Purpose

Implementation plans translate accepted ADRs and roadmap objectives into actionable development sequences with:
- Implementation order and dependencies
- Feature breakdowns by architectural layer
- Risk assessments and mitigation strategies
- Testing strategies
- Observable completion criteria

## Current Plans

| Plan | Status | Duration | ADRs |
|------|--------|----------|------|
| [Near-Term Implementation](near_term_implementation.md) | Ready for Approval | 52-67 days | ADR-025, ADR-026, ADR-027, ADR-031, ADR-039 |

## Relationship to Other Documents

**Strategic Planning**:
- [../plan.md](../plan.md) - High-level project vision and architecture
- [../CONTINUOUS_TECHNICAL_ROADMAP.md](../CONTINUOUS_TECHNICAL_ROADMAP.md) - Living roadmap with current status

**Architectural Decisions**:
- [../adrs/](../adrs/) - Architectural Decision Records (ADRs)
- [../ADR_INDEX.md](../ADR_INDEX.md) - ADR index and summaries

**Execution Rules**:
- [../AGENT_RULES.md](../AGENT_RULES.md) - Non-negotiable implementation constraints

## Plan Lifecycle

1. **Draft** → Plan created based on accepted ADRs
2. **Ready for Approval** → Plan complete, awaiting explicit approval
3. **Approved** → Implementation authorized to begin
4. **In Progress** → Implementation underway
5. **Complete** → All completion criteria met, archived

**Note**: Implementation plans in this directory are tactical documents. They must align with strategic direction (CONTINUOUS_TECHNICAL_ROADMAP.md) and architectural decisions (ADRs).
