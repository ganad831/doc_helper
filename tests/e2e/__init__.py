"""End-to-end workflow tests.

E2E tests verify complete user workflows from start to finish.
These tests exercise the full stack: UI → ViewModel → Application → Domain → Infrastructure.

Test Categories:
- Workflow 1: Create → Edit → Save → Generate
- Workflow 2: Open → Edit → Undo → Save
- Workflow 3: Validation workflow
- Workflow 4: i18n workflow

Note: E2E tests may be slower than unit/integration tests.
